OPTIONAL: Modify the API call to access another subset of data. Include code + comments.
Q5: Select a specific dataset available via an API.
A few sources that might get you started:

GitHub repository with extensive inventory of free public APIs
U.S. National Archives and Records Administration, NARA
Smithsonian Institution
Library of Congress
U.S. Census Bureau
The Sports DB

OPTIONAL: JSON's nested structure can't always be mapped onto a tabular (table-like) data structure. But pandas does include a pd.read_json function if you want to experiment with creating a DataFrame from JSON data.
pandas documentation for pd.read_json
alternate method that converts JSON to dictionary and uses pd.DataFrame.from_dict() method
